oop design anti patterns ???
1. God Object (Blob)
A class that knows too much or does too much.
 It violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and makes the system hard to maintain.

public class GodObject {
    public void SaveToDatabase() { /* ... */ }
    public void RenderUI() { /* ... */ }
    public void CalculateStatistics() { /* ... */ }
    // and many more unrelated methods...
}

Solution:

Refactor the class by separating responsibilities into smaller, more focused classes.
